You also have 3 loose apples on the counter. When you count everything up, you have exactly 2 apples total.\\n\\nSo we have:\\n- Some number of bags (let's call this x bags)\\n- Each bag has 5 apples (so that's 5x apples from bags)\\n- Plus 3 loose apples\\n- Total = 2 apples\\n\\nThis gives us: 5x + 3 = 2\\n\\nNow, here's a question for you to think about: Does this scenario make sense in real life? Can you have a negative number of bags? What might that tell us about our answer?\\n\\nAnd here's your first step to consider: If we want to find out how many bags we have, what should we do first to start isolating the bags from those loose apples?\""
