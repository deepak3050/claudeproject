            "Autoscaling can be triggered according to a schedule, or by assessing whether the system is running short on resources. For example, autoscaling could be triggered if CPU utilization grows, memory occupancy increases, the number of incoming requests to a service appears to be surging, or some combination of factors.",
            "Autoscaling in Azure App Service monitors the resource metrics of a web app as it runs. It detects situations where other resources are required to handle an increasing workload, and ensures those resources are available before the system becomes overloaded.",
            "Autoscaling responds to changes in the environment by adding or removing web servers and balancing the load between them. Autoscaling doesn't have any effect on the CPU power, memory, or storage capacity of the web servers powering the app, it only changes the number of web servers.",
            "Autoscaling makes its decisions based on rules that you define. A rule specifies the threshold for a metric, and triggers an autoscale event when this threshold is crossed. Autoscaling can also deallocate resources when the workload lessens.",
            "Define your autoscaling rules carefully. For example, a Denial of Service attack can result in a large-scale influx of incoming traffic. Trying to handle a surge in requests caused by a DoS attack would be fruitless and expensive. These requests aren't genuine, and should be discarded rather than processed. A better solution is to implement detection and filtering of requests that occur during such an attack before they reach your service.",
            "Autoscaling provides elasticity for your services. For example, you might expect increased/reduced activity for a business app during holidays.",
            "Autoscaling improves availability and fault tolerance. It can help ensure that client requests to a service aren't denied because an instance is either: not able to acknowledge the request in a timely manner; or because an instance has crashed.",
            "Autoscaling works by adding or removing web servers. If your web apps perform  resource-intensive processing as part of each request, then autoscaling might not be an effective approach. In these situations, manually scaling up may be necessary. For example, if a request sent to a web app involves performing complex processing over a large dataset, depending on the instance size, this single request could exhaust the processing and memory capacity of the instance.",
            "Autoscaling isn't the best approach to handling long-term growth. You might have a web app that starts with a few users, but increases in popularity over time. Autoscaling has an overhead associated with monitoring resources and determining whether to trigger a scaling event. In this scenario, if you can anticipate the rate of growth, manually scaling the system over time may be a more cost effective approach.",
            "The number of instances of a service is also a factor. You might expect to run only a few instances of a service most of the time. However, in this situation, your service is susceptible to downtime or lack of availability whether autoscaling is enabled or not. The fewer the number of instances initially, the less capacity you have to handle an increasing workload while autoscaling spins up more instances.",

            "Autoscaling works by analyzing trends in metric values over time across all instances. Analysis is a multi-step process.",
            "In the first step, an autoscale rule aggregates the values retrieved for a metric for all instances across a period of time known as thetime grain. Each metric has its own intrinsic time grain, but in most cases this period is 1 minute. The aggregated value is known as thetime aggregation. The options available areAverage,Minimum,Maximum,Sum,Last, andCount.",
            "An interval of one minute is a short interval in which to determine whether any change in metric is long-lasting enough to make autoscaling worthwhile. So, an autoscale rule performs a second step that performs a further aggregation of the value calculated by thetime aggregationover a longer, user-specified period, known as theDuration. The minimumDurationis 5 minutes. If theDurationis set to 10 minutes for example, the autoscale rule aggregates the 10 values calculated for thetime grain.",
            "The aggregation calculation for theDurationcan be different from the calculation used for thetime grain. For example, if thetime aggregationisAverageand the metric isCPU Percentagewith a one-minutetime grain, each minute the average CPU utilization across all instances is calculated. If the aggregation applied over theDurationis set toMaximum, and theDurationof the rule is 10 minutes, the maximum of the ten per-minute average values for CPU utilization is used to determine whether the rule threshold was crossed.",
            "When an autoscale rule detects that a metric crossed a threshold, it can perform an autoscale action. An autoscale action can bescale-outorscale-in. A scale-out action increases the number of instances, and a scale-in action reduces the instance count. An autoscale action uses an operator (such asless than,greater than,equal to, and so on) to determine how to react to the threshold. Scale-out actions typically use thegreater thanoperator to compare the metric value to the threshold. Scale-in actions tend to compare the metric value to the threshold with theless thanoperator. An autoscale action can also set the instance count to a specific level, rather than incrementing or decrementing the number available.",
            "An autoscale action has acool downperiod, specified in minutes. During this interval, the scale rule can't be triggered again. This is to allow the system to stabilize between autoscale events. Remember that it takes time to start up or shut down instances, and so any metrics gathered might not show any significant changes for several minutes. The minimum cool down period is five minutes.",
            "You should plan for scaling-in when a workload decreases. Consider defining autoscale rules in pairs in the same autoscale condition. One autoscale rule should indicate how to scale the system out when a metric exceeds an upper threshold. Then other rule should define how to scale the system back in again when the same metric drops below a lower threshold.",
            "A single autoscale condition can contain several autoscale rules (for example, a scale-out rule and the corresponding scale-in rule). However, the autoscale rules in an autoscale condition don't have to be directly related. You could define the following four rules in the same autoscale condition:",
            "When determining whether to scale out, the autoscale action is performed ifanyof the scale-out rules are met (HTTP queue length exceeds 10orCPU utilization exceeds 70%). When scaling in, the autoscale action runsonly if allof the scale-in rules are met (HTTP queue length drops to zeroandCPU utilization falls below 50%). If you need to scale in if only one of the scale-in rules are met, you must define the rules in separate autoscale conditions.",
